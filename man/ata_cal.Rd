\title{Calculate Log2 Ratio of Sample Values to Row Means}
\usage{
ata_cal(data = KO_Sample_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix containing numerical values to be processed.
Rows represent features (e.g., KO terms) and columns represent samples.
Default is KO_Sample_table.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the same dimensions as input, where each value is:
- log2(sample_value/row_mean) when both sample_value and row_mean are non-zero
- 0 when either sample_value or row_mean is zero
The Mean_RA column used for calculations is removed from the output.
}
\description{
This function calculates the log2 ratio of each value in a data frame
to its corresponding row mean. Zero values are preserved as zeros in the output.
